>React ðŸ’€ Scaffolding project using **webpack** 2.0 and styling with **styled-components**

## Features

* Webpack with *Code splitting* & *image loaders*
* Styled with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
* Customized airbnb eslint

## Notes
* Need to add to the `webpack.config.js` the vendor packages names (to do the code splitting)
